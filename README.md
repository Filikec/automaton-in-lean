# Formalization of automata in Lean
- This project focuses on defining automata in Lean and proving things about them
- Currently there are two versions for Lean3 and Lean4

## Notes on lean4
- When opening a project in VSCode, use the folder lean4 as the workspace, not the whole project
- Init the project using 'lake update' and 'lake build'
